To do:
- HASS notification for first photo of the day
- status post which says: lipo level, uptime, signal quality, CPSI, git rev
- Log post back to server to catch errors like with startup-modem-manager?
- Figure out a way to POST an image > 4k size through modem API instead of ppp+curl
- Beacon phone home mode: no/oneshot/persist + stateful oneshot + interface from HASS

Good Ideas for safety:
- boot counter based pppd login - every 100 boots?
- separate checkout of beacon code
