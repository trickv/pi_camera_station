Before leaving island:
- try power off: AT+CPOWD=1. will have to do other stuff to wake it up?
tie rope on, install

Can do whenever or only if required:
status post which says: lipo level, uptime, signal quality, CPSI, git rev
POST: first chunk should include md5sum + length; insert to DB
beacon phone home modew: no/oneshot/persist + stateful oneshot

Good Ideas:
boot counter based pppd login - every 100 boots?
separate checkout of beacon code
