Before leaving island:
startup signal delay loop longer
immutable, impossible to break beacon code. separate code base or something? git pegged checkout?
system crontab'd pppd login. even if clock is broken eventually it'll hit?
boot counter based pppd login - every 100 boots?

Can do whenever or only if required:
status post which says: lipo level, uptime, signal quality, CPSI, git rev
POST: first chunk should include md5sum + length; insert to DB
beacon phone home modew: no/oneshot/persist + stateful oneshot

.
