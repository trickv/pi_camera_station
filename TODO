Before leaving island:
wifi shutdown to save power
clock sync
startup signal delay loop longer
GPS locator for if it floats away?
immutable, impossible to break beacon code. separate code base or something? git pegged checkout?
weekly pppd login in case all code goes to hell? requires clock sync or some kind of stateful on disk delay loop to make sure this doesn't run every bloody day and run up the bill for no use.
beacon should git pull

Can do whenever or only if required:
import other ppp scripts
status post which says: lipo level, uptime, signal quality, CPSI, git rev
POST: first chunk should include md5sum + length; insert to DB
beacon phone home modew: no/oneshot/persist + stateful oneshot
