Before leaving island:
tie rope on, install
leave love note for anyone who reads it
system crontab'd pppd login. even if clock is broken eventually it'll hit?

Can do whenever or only if required:
status post which says: lipo level, uptime, signal quality, CPSI, git rev
POST: first chunk should include md5sum + length; insert to DB
beacon phone home modew: no/oneshot/persist + stateful oneshot

Good Ideas:
boot counter based pppd login - every 100 boots?
separate checkout of beacon code
